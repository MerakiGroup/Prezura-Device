## Prezura Device ##

### Overview ###

This repo contains the arduino code of NODE MCU for the the emulation
of the smart shoe, this device will read voltage from  pressure sensors
and broadcast to the server (maybe to the mobile device) in order to
analyze patterns

### Language and Framework ###

This code is written using c++ with arduino, please use this guide to
setup NodeMCU with Arduino IDE,

[Guide](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/esp8266-thing-hookup-guide/installing-the-esp8266-arduino-addon)

Setting up the websocket library,

To setup the websocket library compatible with Arduino IDE zip libs/ESP8266-Websocket folder
and import as a library.
